Silicon photonic circuits are becoming more relevant in computing and AI applications. While it is feasible to simulate
  a single simple silicon photonic circuit with varying manufacturing defects, when trying to
  simulate larger circuits by combining multiple devices, current simulation programs 
  fail due to how complex the transfer matrix equations become. Therefore,
  it is important to build abstraction models to help with simulating complex silicon 
  photonic circuits and engineering software tools that will be able to run those abstraction models for analysis.
