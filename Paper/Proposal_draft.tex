\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


\usepackage{graphicx}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
  Silicon photonic circuits are becoming more relevant in computing and AI applications. While it is feasible to simulate
  a single simple silicon photonic circuit with varying manufacturing defects, when trying to
  simulate larger circuits by combining multiple devices, current simulation programs 
  fail due to how complex the transfer matrix equations become. Therefore,
  it is important to build abstraction models to help with simulating complex silicon 
  photonic circuits and engineering software tools that will be able to run those abstraction models for analysis.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{B}{ased} on the work of Agnihotri et.\ al [1], we know that there is a way to 
simulate a single silicon photonic circuit with varying manufacturing defects. When trying to
simulate larger, more, complex circuits by combining multiple silicon photonic devices, programs
like Ansys Lumerical. Simulations fail due to how complex the transfer matrix equations become. This happens frequently
when trying to model larger complex circuits that have an ever increasing number of photonic optical devices.
Therefore, it is important to build abstraction models to help with simulating those 
complex silicon photonic circuits.\par This proposal is to develop a computer program that 
will read in an interconnected complex circuit photonic and be able to 
simulate and synthesize them. I will need to first develop a data structure 
for the logic blocks in a circuit that are sinusoidal in nature to represent (matrix-based) 
and store the transfer functions that represent the devices. With the data structure abstraction 
in place, I can now represent the silicon photonic circuit in parts and build complex 
circuits through a netlist. This program will be built with the Python programing language. 
The toughest challenge will be finding the data structure design that is the most appropriate
and can be integrated to read and create the circuits with the Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools within the project. 
One of the benefits of my program will be representing any known manufacturing defect of a silicon 
photonic circuit and run an algorithm to determine the best location within the circuit 
to do post-fabrication tuning (affecting reflective index). This will improve yield 
and reduce cost for silicon photonic circuits.

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)


\section{History}
Efforts are needed to develop defect models, tests, and validation procedures [1].
These silicon photonic devices are sensitive to changes in the manufacturing process and defects 
can occur in these devices at a very small scale. It can geometrically change the circuit design 
which will affect the refractive index of waveguides and potentially cause the circuit to 
malfunction [1].
\par Photonic silicon circuits can be modeled and represented through transfer matrix
  equations [1]. To do this, more parameters can be added to the optical circuits.
  The parameters can also be added to transfer matrices as phase modulators. By creating simulations 
  of these photonic optical devices, you can represent manufacturing defects and simulate 
  the behavior of the circuits as well as determine the best place to make fixes within the circuit. 
\par In order to create these circuits, one can use optical switching devices,
  such as crossbar and Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) as shown in Fig. 1.
  With these designs, you can apply logic synthesis methodologies for 
  large-scale optical circuits [2].  There have been other simulations created for
  single optical devices that have shown success in efficiently evaluating the circuit performance.
  This also allows us to change parameters which correlate to how the circuit performs,
  showing that this work can be extended to large scale photonic circuit simulations [3].

\section{Proposal}
Building this python program that will be able to read silicon
photonic circuits will help researchers simulate and verify how well these
circuits work. Also by implementing debugging tools, researchers will be able
to find focal points in the circuit that need to be modified to improve the output.
This program will be very useful to many researchers by giving them the opportunity 
to test out their circuits and make design improvements. This program
will be helpful with post-fabrication tuning when circuits have any manufacturing defects
and in return will improve yield and reduce cost for silicon photonic circuits. This approach
brings design-for-test to Si-photonics.
\subsection{Project Tasks}
During this upcoming fall semester, I will need to develop the data structure that will 
represent the silicon photonic devices. These devices and their operations can be
represented by a transfer matrix. Once this data structure is developed, I will move 
onto being able to read a file format containing multiple transfer matrices and composing
a TM model for a complex si-photonic circuit.
 Once the program can read in silicon photonic circuit files and successfully
build them and simulate them, I will want to start building the debugging tools. One tool
that will be useful is implementing a topological sorting algorithm that will find any point
within the circuit where weak output signals appear, i.e. weak controllability or observability.
This will help the user know where to modify the circuit for better output results.
\subsection{Management and Communication} 
I plan to spend about 8 hours every week working 
on the project and I will be reporting to Professor Priyank Kalla.
A planned out Schedule will be followed to ensure progress is made for this project.  
\subsection{Milestones}
\subsubsection*{Milestone 1} I plan to research and experiment with different 
data structures that I find best fitting to represent and hold photonic 
circuit's transfer matrix equations. This will also include choosing the 
best programming language that will allow me to create my program with 
the most efficiency possible. I also will be developing the file type 
needed to store these circuits that can also be read from by a program.  
\subsubsection*{Milestone 2}During these next two weeks I will start 
creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to help myself plan out
the key features and implementations I want in my program. I will also 
be researching what types of programming libraries are out there that 
can help me create a more efficient program. 
\subsubsection*{Milestone 3}I plan to begin the process of writing the code
for my program and making sure I follow my UML design. I will break each 
part of my program into smaller parts so that I do not overwhelm myself 
by trying to write different parts of the program at the same time. 
Finishing the first small instance of my program which will be the 
data structure system and file read/write process. 
\subsubsection*{Milestone 4}Implement the topological sorting algorithm to 
measure and find the best point to debug a faulty or inefficient optical 
device within the circuit. I know this part will take me a little longer 
because there will be a lot of trial and error to fine-tune the algorithm 
and there might be a chance that I need to use a completely different algorithm 
than I anticipated. For that reason, I am giving myself more time to make 
sure I can find a good efficient algorithm.
\subsubsection*{Milestone 5}I will move on to the final part of the program
which will be to visually represent the circuit I read from a file to 
the user in the program through a graphical user interface (GUI).  
I want the GUI to show the design of the circuit and outline the different 
parts within the circuit so the user can see each optical device within it. 
I also want to display any important information about the circuit to the 
user based on the file it reads in.

 
\subsubsection*{Milestone 6}At this point, I should have everything I wanted 
to implement in my program completed and will be fixing up all my code and making 
improvements where they need to be to make sure my GUI looks clean and easy 
to understand. I will also be checking in with my mentoring professor and asking 
if there are any details or features that I should add. I will be making this 
period somewhat light so that I can focus on finishing my classes with good 
grades as well as beginning to study for my finals.

\subsection{Components to be Purchased/Built}
This project will be built using python which is an open source programing 
language that I will use to build the program. A computer that has 
python installed on it and the VS Code application is the only current
item on the bill of materials, which have been acquired. However, some books 
may need to be purchased to answer questions if my current available resources
cannot answer them. 

\subsection{Testing and Integration}
Testing of my program will happen at different stages like testing the data structure, file system and reading circuit.
I will follow my design plan starting with creating the data structure
that will store the transfer matrices for each circuit. Once I can store the
circuit, I will move onto being able to read a file type that contains multiple
transfer matrices. After, I will put these two pieces together to be able to
represent the circuit and simulate the output. Finally, I will have to test different
topological algorithms that will help with locating weak output points in the circuit.
\par By breaking the program into these parts, I can do incremental testing to verify each
step in the building process. Once I know that the current step has been tested thoroughly,
I can begin putting the parts together and testing the build as a whole. 
\subsection{Risk Assessment}
The main risk for this project will be the data structure that I create to represent
and hold and store the transfer matrix. This data structure is the foundational block
to my program because it will be the main entry point for any simulation or debugging.
Making the data structure the main priority will allow me to research different options
while testing different structures to find one that works appropriately.
\par Other medium risks are simulating the circuits and the debugging tool because both
will be based on an algorithm that I implement. I need to make sure the algorithms I
choose work with the transfer matrices. Currently, there is a Ph.D student working with
under the same Professor as me who has had success with simulating a single device circuit.
I will make sure to ask this student for help if I begin struggling with the simulation
since they already have experience.  
\subsection{Deliverables}
The final deliverable will be a fully functional python program that can simulate
and debug complex silicone photonic circuits. This program should be able to
show the user where there may be some rework needed within their circuit or even
show how to improve any manufactured defects within a circuit.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
